### Day 1: January 30, 2017

This is my first day of #100daysofcode. I decided to start this challenge because for the last year I've been doing lots of tutorials, and I want to start making projects so I can get a job as a Front End Developer. Also, I wanted to do this challenge because I needed a distraction of what is going on arount the globe regarding DT. It was stressing me out, so I'm back to coding. Today I worked on the Random Quote App from freeCodeCamp.com. I was able to get random background colors and the color to match.

**mood**: feeling good for being first day.

**project**: [Random Quote App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/randomQuote/)

---


### Day 2: January 31, Tuesday

Today I implemented buttons and twitter icon on the Random Quote App. I did a bit of Javascript to change the background of the buttons, but I haven't started on the Random Quote API. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to work more on JS.

**mood**: feeling a bit under the weather (sick), so I couldn't advance very much on the app.

**project**: [Random Quote App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/randomQuote/)

---


### day 3: February 1, Wednesday

At first I wasn't sure how I was going to implement the API into my app, but after going through a [tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) on Udacity, things became a lot clearer. The buttons are not fully functional, and that's what I'm planning to work on tomorrow morning.

**mood**: I was feeling a little better than yesterday in regards to the cold that I have, and I was able to concentrate more on the JavaScript side. Overall I was feeling happy and eagered to learn new stuff.

**project**: [Random Quote App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/randomQuote/)

---

### Day 4: February 2, Thursday

Tried to finish the Random Quote App, but I couldn't get to re-tweet the quote. I will work on it a little more on Friday. If anybody has any ideas how to do this or where I can go to learn about it, I appreciate it.

**mood**: I'm still a little sick, but I was able to code for a little bit more than an hour. Donald Trump is still stressing me out.

**project**: [Random Quote App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/randomQuote/)

---

### Day 5: February 3, Friday

Finished the Random Quote App by implementing some images in the background, and I was able to retweet the quote to my tweeter account. Now I'm on to the next challenge in FreeCodeCamp.com which is the Local Weather App.

**mood**: I was feeling really good, I coded for about 4 hours and I couldnt stop. I wanted to keep going but it's 2 AM, and I need to get some sleep...zzzz!!

**project**: [Random Quote App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/randomQuote/)

---

### Day 6: February 4, Saturday

Today I started the Weather App, so most of my time today was to get it ready and look at some examples for the App.

**mood**: Since it was Saturday, I decided to only code for a little bit, but I was feeling good and a little anxious to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday. I don't know if I'm going to find the time to code tomorrow with this anxiety....GO FALCONS!! Falcons 35 - New England 20

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 7: February 5, Sunday

Working on the Weather App, I've been looking for the right weather API, but I'm not sure which one to use. I got some of the CSS and the HTML done, but I still got to get the footer on the right position, and I have to bring in the API.

**mood**: I was feeling good, but most of the time I was thinking about the Super Bowl, so I couldn't concentrate very much; Beside, I think I drank too much so I couldn't get a lot done today.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 8: February 6, Monday

Worked a little more on the Weather App, I'm still trying to figure out which API to use, and work on design and color.

**mood**: I didn't make too much progress. Work for about an hour, but I was a little tired since I work most of the day.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 9: February 7, Tuesday

I'm still having trouble which API to use, but I think I finally found good documentation from the Accuweather API.

**mood**: I've been working all day for the last 2 days, so I haven't been coding as much as I want. I've been a little tired, and I haven't been able to stay awake more more than an hour. I've been trying to code more than an hour the last 2 days, but sleep is getting the best of me. Today and tomorrow I'll be working all day again, so I don't think I'll be advancing too much.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 10: February 8, Wednesday

I'm having so much trouble with the API, I can't seem to be able to bring in the data into my App. I will keep at it for the next couple of days. I think that I've been so tired lately that I can't concentrate too much.

**mood**: Today I was able to work on my code for a little longer, and I started earlier so I wouldn't fall asleep on my computer. :)

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 11: February 9, Thursday

I'm still having trouble with the weather API. I can't get the object to from openweather.org.

**mood**: Not feeling too good. It's been a long week, and I'm really tired. My job is making me work a lot, and I can't concentrate too much on code. :(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 12: February 10, Friday

I'm still trying to get the API to work, and it's getting very frustrating.

**mood**: Not in the mood to code. I'm not getting any results, so this is the times when I feel I'm not a good developer. It's so furstrating!!! ;(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 13: February 11, Saturday

Not very much progress. I guess I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding the documentation. I'm having a little problem understanding what is the difference between $.ajax and $.getJSON, so I'm doing some reading about it.

**mood**: I'm tired and I just want to rest. ;(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 14: February 12, Sunday

Today I worked a little on the front end. I was experimenting a little with the css and implementing bootstap into the project.

**mood**: I felt a little better than the last couple of days, but I'm still tired from my job. ;|

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 15: February 13, Monday

Today I wasn't able to work on the project a lot, so I did some reading on JavaScript regarding APIs.

**mood**: I wasn't in the mood to code at all.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 16: February 14, Tuesday

I totally changed my approach to tackle the problem I've been having with the API, so I've been looking at some examples on Codepen to see how other people have been doing their app. I was able to learn a lot, and hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get the weather to show up on the page.

**mood**: I felt much better today. I was able to learn a lot by looking at other people's projects, and that help me out a lot...it busted my confidence a bit.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 17: February 15, Wednesday

Worked on the API, and I was able to connect, but now I'm having trouble retrieving the right input from the input field. I'm not sure what could be wrong. I'm asking on Gitter and hopefully I'll get an answer soon.

**mood**: Feeling good since I was able to get the API to show up, but frustrated at the same time because of not getting the right input back.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 18: February 16, Thursday

It took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong regarding the value of the input field, and why I wasn't getting the correct results, but I finally was able to resolve the issue. I will be working on displaying the data on the page.

**mood**: I was in a great mood because I finally was able to advance a whole lot on the app. Tomorrow hopefully I'll be able to display the data...I'm getting some of my confidence back!!!

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 19: February 17, Friday

Today I worked on resolving the issue where if the user would put either the city or the zip code the right results came out.

**mood**: I was feeling good, and I was able to work on the app for more than 2 hours for the first time this week.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 20: February 18, Saturday

Today I'm trying to work on the front end and geolocation. I'm not sure what to display on the site.

**mood**: Felt rested, but I did have a little anxiety because I had to do a lot of thing around the house.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 21: February 19, Sunday

I was able to get geolocation working, and show up on the front end. Now I'll be working on putting all the info in the front end of the app.

**mood**: I'm coming down with a cold, so I didn't fee very good trying to get my code to work. I'll probably feel worst tomorrow, so I'm not sure how I'm going to get any coding done.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 22: February 20, Monday

Not very much was done because of my cold, but I was able to work a little more on js trying to get the right values from the api.

**mood**: feeling pretty sick. not in the mood to code at all.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 23: February 21, Tuesday

Today I work on the toggle button to change Fehrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa. I wasn't able to figure it out by myself. I did get some help from Stack-Overflow and watching a video from youtube.

**mood**: I still have a cold, but I was able to code for more than 2 hours. I was feeling good.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 24: February 22, Wednesday

My toggle button was having some difficulties because it was triggering multiple times everytime it was being clicked. I was able to figure it out with the bind() method.

**mood**: Feeling much better. my cold is almost gone, and the weekend is almost here. :)

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 25: February 23, Thursday

I've been trying to display the 7 day forecast, but I haven't been successful. The requisites for the app are all done, but I want to add a little more info.

**mood**: Today I finally I got over my cold...feeling good about coding.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 26: February 24, Friday

I'm still looking for a way to display the 7 day forecast. I spent a few minutes only trying to figure it out, but I still not able to do it. I'm afraid it's going to take me a while.

**mood**: Feeling good with lots of energy and willingness to learn how to itirate through an object.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 27: February 28, Tuesday

I had to take 3 days off because I went on vacation for 3 days, so hopefully this doesn't mean I have to start over. I went back to the Weather App, and I'm still trying to display the 7 day forecast. I'm not sure if I should iterate through the object or what. I've been looking through some youtube videos for some examples, but I still haven't found what I've been looking for.

**mood**: At first, I was feeling like wanting to quit coding because I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get a solution for the app on how to display the 7 day forecast, but once I got started I couldn't stop. I still haven't figured it out, but it was fun looking through all the videos, and some MDN documentation regarding Objects and how to iterate through them.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 28: March 1, Wednesday

Worked on the Weather App....I was able to bring in the weekday from the Date() method using the Unix Timestamp from the API.

**mood**: feeling a bit tired from work, but was able to code for about and hour and a half. I felt pretty good.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 29: March 2, Thursday

Finished the Weather App for now. I think it's functional, but as far as design, I will work on it a little bit later after I finsih the 100 days of code challenge.

**mood**: I was feeling good, but was falling asleep because it was a bit late when I was coding.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 30: March 3, Friday

Today I started working on the Wikipedia Viewer App for FreeCodeCamp. I'm dealing with the setup and looking at some examples.

**mood**: It's Friday, so not in the mood to code. Feeling a little lazy, but doing my best to work for at least 1 hour.

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 31: March 5, Sunday

As you can see, I skipped a day, but I'd had to say I had to take another break because I was invited for wine tasting in Woodinville, WA, and I couldn't resist....I LOVE WINE!! Anyways, today I did some finishing touches to the Weather App and worked on the Wikipedia Viewer App using HTML, CSS, and JS.

**mood**: I felt a little anxious. I feel anxious because every time I start a new project I'm not sure where to start. I'm all over the place, and then I start getting lots of information and looking at examples that would help me with the project.

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 32: March 6, Monday

Worked on the Wikipedia Viewer App, but I can't get the data to appear on the site. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have better luck.

**mood**: Felt great since it's the start of the week and a new project. I did feel a little frustrated because I couldn't get the data to appear on the page, but that's the life of a programmer....I guess :)

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 34: March 8, Wednesday

As I was working on the Wikipedia Viewer App, for some reason the data is not coming through and now I can't get it to work. I spent more than 2 hours trying to figure it out, but I wasn't able to do it. I will work on it more tomorrow.

**mood**: frustrated because I'm not sure what could be the problem.

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 36: March 10, Friday

I'm not sure what's going on with my app still. I'm going to stack-overflow to see if anybody is able to help me because I still can't figure it out why the data is not coming back from the API when it was working fine 3 days ago.

**mood**: feeling very mad and frustrated :(

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 38: March 12, Sunday

I worked on the styling of the Wikipedia Viewer App, and I was finally able to finish. It took me more than anticipated because of the little problem I had on the front-end, but now I'm moving on to the next project which is the Twitchtv JSON API.

**mood**: feeling good and excited to start another project.

**project**: [Wikipedia Viewer App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WikipediaViewer/)

---

### Day 39: March 13, Monday

Today I started the TwitcTV JSON API project, so mostly what I did today was setup the project and make sure all the files were loading correctly as well as the CDNs.

**mood**: I was a little tired from work, but I was able to code for half an hour.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 40: March 14, Tuesday

I mostly did research for the Twitch API, but seems a like I need a client ID to be able to get the API to function. I'm still not sure what I need to do for the project, but as I read more, about it, the cleare it's getting.

**mood**: feeling confused because I'm not sure I understand what I need to do for the project.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 41: March 15, Wednesday

Today I spent most of the time trying to get the API to work, but apparently the website is not working, so I'm going to come back to this project and leave it as a pending project. Apparently, freeCodeCamp is getting rid of this project soon.

**mood**: frustrated at times because I didn't know what I supoosed to be doing with this project and because the API wasn't working.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 42: March 16, Thursday

I'm trying to skip this project because I have no idea what is being asked to do with the project. Today I mostly tried figuring out what's the best version of the API is best for my app.

**mood**: still very frustrated because I'm not sure what to do.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 43: March 17, Friday

I still can't get the API to work, and I'm getting really frustrated. I wasn't able to work on it a lot because it's Friday. On Fridays, I usually go out to dinner and drinks, so it doesn't leave me a lot of time on the day to do a lot of coding.

**mood**: feeling lazy due to Friday symptoms :)

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 44: March 19, Sunday

Not much done due to the fact that I still can't get the twitchTV API to work. I will try again tomorrow.

**mod**: not feeling good because I can't get anything to show from the API

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 45: March 20, Monday

I spent more than 3 hours on the TwitchTV API, and I noticed that Chrome is giving me an error on the console that has to do with the TwitchTV site, and that's the reason probable I haven't been able to advance on the project. I will try tomorrow hoping I can achieve something.

**mood**: a bit relieved because the problem is not on my end, but frustrated because I've been on this project for almost 2 weeks, and I haven't been able to advance to my next project.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 46: March 21, Tuesday

I was able to bring in data to the front-end....FINALLY!!! Now I will be working on the design and what kind of data I want to bring in from the API.

**mood**: Feeling good for the first time in a long time.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 46: March 22, Wednesday

Trying to figure out how to find out if the user is offline or online. I wasn't able to spend a lot of time on the project today because I had to work all day on my job.

**mood**: tired and sleepy because of my job....will go get some rest now!

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 47: March 23, Thursday

I was able to figure out if the user is online or offline, but I can't get the status to align with the right group. Everytime it refreshes it either goes gives me the wrong status for the user, or it says 'undefined'. I need to work on it a little more.

**mood**: Feeling good, but at the same time defeated because I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why it's not giving me the correct status for the user.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 48: March 24, Friday

Friday is my drinking day, so I usually only have time for 30 minutes of coding, so mostly I worked on the front-end.

**mood**: feeling bad for not coding enough and not being able to finish the project to move on to the next one.

**project**: [TwitchTV JSON API App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/TwitchTV/)

---

### Day 49: March 25, Saturday

I finally was able to align the right status with the user. Now I'm moving on to the next user story.

**mood**: feeling good after figuring out the problem
