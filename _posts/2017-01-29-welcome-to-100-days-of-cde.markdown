### Day 1: January 30, 2017

This is my first day of #100daysofcode. I decided to start this challenge because for the last year I've been doing lots of tutorials, and I want to start making projects so I can get a job as a Front End Developer. Also, I wanted to do this challenge because I needed a distraction of what is going on arount the globe regarding DT. It was stressing me out, so I'm back to coding. Today I worked on the Random Quote App from freeCodeCamp.com. I was able to get random background colors and the color to match.

**mood**: feeling good for being first day.

### Day 2: January 31, Tuesday

Today I implemented buttons and twitter icon on the Random Quote App. I did a bit of Javascript to change the background of the buttons, but I haven't started on the Random Quote API. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to work more on JS.

**mood**: feeling a bit under the weather (sick), so I couldn't advance very much on the app.

### day 3: February 1, Wednesday

At first I wasn't sure how I was going to implement the API into my app, but after going through a [tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) on Udacity, things became a lot clearer. The buttons are not fully functional, and that's what I'm planning to work on tomorrow morning.

**mood**: I was feeling a little better than yesterday in regards to the cold that I have, and I was able to concentrate more on the JavaScript side. Overall I was feeling happy and eagered to learn new stuff.

### Day 4: February 2, Thursday

Tried to finish the Random Quote App, but I couldn't get to re-tweet the quote. I will work on it a little more on Friday. If anybody has any ideas how to do this or where I can go to learn about it, I appreciate it.

**mood**: I'm still a little sick, but I was able to code for a little bit more than an hour. Donald Trump is still stressing me out.

### Day 5: February 3, Friday

Finished the Random Quote App by implementing some images in the background, and I was able to retweet the quote to my tweeter account. Now I'm on to the next challenge in FreeCodeCamp.com which is the Local Weather App.

**mood**: I was feeling really good, I coded for about 4 hours and I couldnt stop. I wanted to keep going but it's 2 AM, and I need to get some sleep...zzzz!!

### Day 6: February 4, Saturday

Today I started the Weather App, so most of my time today was to get it ready and look at some examples for the App.

**mood**: Since it was Saturday, I decided to only code for a little bit, but I was feeling good and a little anxious to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday. I don't know if I'm going to find the time to code tomorrow with this anxiety....GO FALCONS!! Falcons 35 - New England 20

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

### Day 7: February 5, Sunday

Working on the Weather App, I've been looking for the right weather API, but I'm not sure which one to use. I got some of the CSS and the HTML done, but I still got to get the footer on the right position, and I have to bring in the API.

**mood**: I was feeling good, but most of the time I was thinking about the Super Bowl, so I couldn't concentrate very much; Beside, I think I drank too much so I couldn't get a lot done today.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 8: February 6, Monday

Worked a little more on the Weather App, I'm still trying to figure out which API to use, and work on design and color.

**mood**: I didn't make too much progress. Work for about an hour, but I was a little tired since I work most of the day.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 9: February 7, Tuesday

I'm still having trouble which API to use, but I think I finally found good documentation from the Accuweather API.

**mood**: I've been working all day for the last 2 days, so I haven't been coding as much as I want. I've been a little tired, and I haven't been able to stay awake more more than an hour. I've been trying to code more than an hour the last 2 days, but sleep is getting the best of me. Today and tomorrow I'll be working all day again, so I don't think I'll be advancing too much.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

### Day 10: February 8, Wednesday

I'm having so much trouble with the API, I can't seem to be able to bring in the data into my App. I will keep at it for the next couple of days. I think that I've been so tired lately that I can't concentrate too much.

**mood**: Today I was able to work on my code for a little longer, and I started earlier so I wouldn't fall asleep on my computer. :)

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 11: February 9, Thursday

I'm still having trouble with the weather API. I can't get the object to from openweather.org.

**mood**: Not feeling too good. It's been a long week, and I'm really tired. My job is making me work a lot, and I can't concentrate too much on code. :(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 12: February 10, Friday

I'm still trying to get the API to work, and it's getting very frustrating.

**mood**: Not in the mood to code. I'm not getting any results, so this is the times when I feel I'm not a good developer. It's so furstrating!!! ;(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 13: February 11, Saturday

Not very much progress. I guess I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding the documentation. I'm having a little problem understanding what is the difference between $.ajax and $.getJSON, so I'm doing some reading about it.

**mood**: I'm tired and I just want to rest. ;(

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 14: February 12, Sunday

Today I worked a little on the front end. I was experimenting a little with the css and implementing bootstap into the project.

**mood**: I felt a little better than the last couple of days, but I'm still tired from my job. ;|

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 15: February 13, Monday

Today I wasn't able to work on the project a lot, so I did some reading on JavaScript regarding APIs.

**mood**: I wasn't in the mood to code at all.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 16: February 14, Tuesday

I totally changed my approach to tackle the problem I've been having with the API, so I've been looking at some examples on Codepen to see how other people have been doing their app. I was able to learn a lot, and hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get the weather to show up on the page.

**mood**: I felt much better today. I was able to learn a lot by looking at other people's projects, and that help me out a lot...it busted my confidence a bit.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 17: February 15, Wednesday

Worked on the API, and I was able to connect, but now I'm having trouble retrieving the right input from the input field. I'm not sure what could be wrong. I'm asking on Gitter and hopefully I'll get an answer soon.

**mood**: Feeling good since I was able to get the API to show up, but frustrated at the same time because of not getting the right input back.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 18: February 16, Thursday

It took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong regarding the value of the input field, and why I wasn't getting the correct results, but I finally was able to resolve the issue. I will be working on displaying the data on the page.

**mood**: I was in a great mood because I finally was able to advance a whole lot on the app. Tomorrow hopefully I'll be able to display the data...I'm getting some of my confidence back!!!

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 19: February 17, Friday

Today I worked on resolving the issue where if the user would put either the city or the zip code the right results came out.

**mood**: I was feeling good, and I was able to work on the app for more than 2 hours for the first time this week.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)

---

### Day 20: February 18, Saturday

Today I'm trying to work on the front end and geolocation. I'm not sure what to display on the site.

**mood**: Felt rested, but I did have a little anxiety because I had to do a lot of thing around the house.

**project**: [Weather App](http://www.fernandogomez.io/WeatherApp/)
