### Day 1: January 30, 2017

This is my first day of #100daysofcode. I decided to start this challenge because for the last year I've been doing lots of tutorials, and I want to start making projects so I can get a job as a Front End Developer. Also, I wanted to do this challenge because I needed a distraction of what is going on arount the globe regarding DT. It was stressing me out, so I'm back to coding. Today I worked on the Random Quote App from freeCodeCamp.com. I was able to get random background colors and the color to match.

**mood**: feeling good for being first day.

### Day 2: January 31, Tuesday

Today I implemented buttons and twitter icon on the Random Quote App. I did a bit of Javascript to change the background of the buttons, but I haven't started on the Random Quote API. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to work more on JS.

**mood**: feeling a bit under the weather (sick), so I couldn't advance very much on the app.

### day 3: February 1, Wednesday

At first I wasn't sure how I was going to implement the API into my app, but after going through a [tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) on Udacity, things became a lot clearer. The buttons are not fully functional, and that's what I'm planning to work on tomorrow morning.

**mood**: I was feeling a little better than yesterday in regards to the cold that I have, and I was able to concentrate more on the JavaScript side. Overall I was feeling happy and eagered to learn new stuff.

### Day 4: February 2, Thursday

Tried to finish the Random Quote App, but I couldn't get to re-tweet the quote. I will work on it a little more on Friday. If anybody has any ideas how to do this or where I can go to learn about it, I appreciate it.

**mood**: I'm still a little sick, but I was able to code for a little bit more than an hour. Donald Trump is still stressing me out.

### Day 5: February 3, Friday

Finished the Random Quote App by implementing some images in the background, and I was able to retweet the quote to my tweeter account. Now I'm on to the next challenge in FreeCodeCamp.com which is the Local Weather App.

**mood**: I was feeling really good, I coded for about 4 hours and I couldnt stop. I wanted to keep going but it's 2 AM, and I need to get some sleep...zzzz!!

### Day 6: February 4, Saturday

Today I started the Weather App, so most of my time today was to get it ready and look at some examples for the App.

**mood**: Since it was Saturday, I decided to only code for a little bit, but I was feeling good and a little anxious to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday. I don't know if I'm going to find the time to code tomorrow with this anxiety....GO FALCONS!! Falcons 35 - New England 20

### Day 7: February 5, Sunday

Working on the Weather App, I've been looking for the right weather API, but I'm not sure which one to use. I got some of the CSS and the HTML done, but I still got to get the footer on the right position, and I have to bring in the API.

**mood**: I was feeling good, but most of the time I was thinking about the Super Bowl, so I couldn't concentrate very much; Beside, I think I drank too much so I couldn't get a lot done today.

### Day 8: February 6, Monday

Worked a little more on the Weather App, I'm still trying to figure out which API to use, and work on design and color.

**mood**: I didn't make too much progress. Work for about an hour, but I was a little tired since I work most of the day.

### Day 9: February 6, Tuesday

I'm still having trouble which API to use, but I think I finally found good documentation from the Accuweather API.

**mood**: I've been working all day for the last 2 days, so I haven't been coding as much as I want. I've been a little tired, and I haven't been able to stay awake more more than an hour. I've been trying to code more than an hour the last 2 days, but sleep is getting the best of me. Today and tomorrow I'll be working all day again, so I don't think I'll be advancing too much.
